# Trip Planner

By Bryan Austin Suharta (1123137)

## ‚ú® Features

### Trip Management
- Create new trips with name, description, date range, and participant count
- View a list of all trips
- Search trips by name or date
- Sort trips by name or date
- Update trip details
- Delete trips

### Destination Management
- Add destinations to trips with name, number of nights, and activities
- View destinations associated with a specific trip
- Search destinations by name
- Update destination details
- Delete destinations

### Freestyle 1 (without API)
I implemented a sorting feature when viewing all the trips. User is able to sort Trips 
based on their earliest or latest start date and alphabetically

### Freestyle 2 (with API)
Using image API from Unsplash.com

What it does
The application automatically fetches relevant travel images from Unsplash to serve as cover photos for each trip, enhancing the visual experience without requiring users to upload their own images.

How it works
1. When a user creates a trip, the backend extracts the trip name
2. The name is sent as a search query to Unsplash's API
3. The first matching image is retrieved and stored with the trip data
4. This image is displayed as the trip's cover photo on the home page
5. If the API call fails, a default backup image is used instead

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- API Key
- Database URL from Supabase

### How to get the API Key
1. Go to unsplash.com
2. Log in or create a new account
3. Click the burger menu on the right side, then click Developers/API OR directly go to unsplash.com/developers
4. Open "Your apps"
5. Click "New Application" and accept the API Use and Guidelines
6. Write in your application name and description
   Example: 
   - App name: FWE Trip Planning App 
   - Description: An app to plan trip
7. At the bottom of the page, copy both Access Key and Secret Key
8. In the IDE, create a new .env file in root and paste in the API Keys like this:
   ```bash
    UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY="ACCESS_KEY"
    UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY="SECRET_KEY"
   ```

### How to get the Database URL
1. Go to supabase.com
2. Log in using Github or create a new account
3. Create a new Organization or click an existing one
4. Create a New Project and type in the name and password
5. In the project page, click "Connect" in the header middle section of the page
6. Copy URL in the Session pooler. It looks similar to this: postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT_ID]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
7. In the .env file, paste the URL and add the port number: 
   ```bash
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL="[URL]"
   ```
### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://code.fbi.h-da.de/bryanaustin.suharta/FWE-SS-25-1123137.git
   cd FWE-SS-25-1123137/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   ```

4. Run database migrations
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

5. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Testing with Postman
1. Import the included Postman collection from this [link](https://bryanaustin.postman.co/workspace/Bryan-Austin's-Workspace~3591a0af-516f-4c27-89ed-7e6f5b66beb6/collection/44118307-beabb353-c46c-4df0-b759-26c86a173d9e?action=share&creator=44118307)
2. Execute the collection to run all tests

## üìä Data Relationships
- Each trip can have multiple destinations (one-to-many relationship)
- Destinations belong to a single trip (enforced by foreign key constraint)
- When a trip is deleted, all associated destinations are automatically deleted (cascade delete)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Backend
- Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL
- OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
- Supabase for Backend-as-a-Service

### Frontend
- React, TypeScript, Vite
- Mantine UI component library
- React Router for navigation
- Auto-generated TypeScript API client

### Development Tools
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Postman for API testing
